# ISSRE 2025 - Towards an automated choice of topology for cloud application deployment based on FinOps practices

This repository contains files and content introduced in the paper "Towards an automated choice of topology for cloud application deployment based on FinOps practices" submitted to ISSRE 2025, and is organized this way:

### Repository Content:

1. [Files automatically generated by G-FinOps tool:](#files-automatically-generated-by-g-finops-tool)
2. [Cloud-Native TOSCA Profile](#cloud-native-tosca-profile)

## Files automatically generated by G-FinOps tool:

In this section, we present files generated for the following applications:

- Wonky (https://github.com/domix/wonky)
- Jeeshop (https://github.com/RealJeeshop/jeeshop)
- Homepage (https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage)

They are in the following directories:

| Directory                     | Content                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [dockerfiles](./dockerfiles/) | Dockerfiles generated by G-FinOps for the same applications. Each application has its subdirectory.                                                                                    |
| [charts](./charts/)           | The Helm charts generated by G-FinOps. They enable the deployment of these applications to a Kubernetes cluster. Each chart is inside a subdirectory with the name of the application. |

## Cloud-Native TOSCA Profile

We introduced in the paper "Towards an automated choice of topology for cloud application deployment based on FinOps practices" submitted to ISSRE 2025 the Cloud-Native TOSCA Profile - Version 1.0.0 to enable users to model cloud-native application topology in a simple way using TOSCA. Read more about it:
