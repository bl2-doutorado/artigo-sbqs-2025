# A-FinOps: a framework definition aiming to automate decision-making for multi-cloud application deployment

This repository contains files and content introduced in the paper "A-FinOps: a framework definition aiming to automate decision-making for multi-cloud application deployment", and is organized this way:

### Repository Content:

1. [Files automatically generated by G-FinOps tool:](#files-automatically-generated-by-g-finops-tool)
2. [Cloud-Native TOSCA Profile](#cloud-native-tosca-profile)

## Files automatically generated by G-FinOps tool:

In this section, we present files generated for the following applications:

- Wonky (https://github.com/domix/wonky)
- Jeeshop (https://github.com/RealJeeshop/jeeshop)
- Homepage (https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage)

They are in the following directories:

| Directory                     | Content                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [dockerfiles](./dockerfiles/) | Dockerfiles generated by G-FinOps for the same applications. Each application has its subdirectory.                                                                                    |
| [charts](./charts/)           | The Helm charts generated by G-FinOps. They enable the deployment of these applications to a Kubernetes cluster. Each chart is inside a subdirectory with the name of the application. |

## Cloud-Native TOSCA Profile

We introduced in the paper "Towards an automated choice of topology for cloud application deployment based on FinOps practices" submitted to ISSRE 2025 the Cloud-Native TOSCA Profile - Version 1.0.0 to enable users to model cloud-native application topology in a simple way using TOSCA. Read more about it:
